# Object-detection-and-tracking-using-yolov3-and-deepsort
Implemented object detection and tracking using YOLOv3 and Deep SORT. YOLOv3 uses a convolutional neural network for object detection, and Deep SORT combines this with motion data for accurate tracking. this can be used for various applications such as surveillance or self-driving vehicles.
